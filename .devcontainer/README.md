## docker of ms-swift-train


### configure.`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`
copy and adjust the container layout configuration of the `Dev Containers` plugin according to the actual situation, focusing mainly on the path mapping of `/root/cache` and whether to configure the proxy `PROXY``
```shell
cp .devcontainer/docker-compose-demo.yml .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml
```


### run .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
the `Dev Containers` mode of vscode, refer to[vscode_devcontainer docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container)
- install the `Dev Containers` plugin for vscode
- shortcut key 'Ctrl+Shift+P' to open the command panel, select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
- automatically build the container and wait for completion to access the workspace inside the container


### optional steps
- build docker
    ```shell
    docker build . -t samge/ms-swift-train-base -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile-dev-base --build-arg PROXY=http://192.168.3.169:7890
    ```

- upload
    ```shell
    docker push samge/ms-swift-train-base
    ```

- If you encounter the following types of errors, it may be due to issues with the NVIDIA graphics card driver. Try reinstalling the graphics card driver and then restart the system. If you are using the latest version of the graphics card driver, consider downgrading to an earlier version and then try again.
